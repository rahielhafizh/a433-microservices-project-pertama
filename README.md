This is the first project of the course  “Learn to Build Microservices Architecture”. The project involves deploying an item application using Docker Compose. The focus is on container orchestration and service management. The project includes creating a Dockerfile for custom image creation, writing scripts for automated deployment, and setting files to define services such as item-app and item-db. By implementing efficient networking and volume management, the application implements containerization, microservices, and scripting to automate a complex environment.
