This project uses Docker Compose to deploy the Item App application. Using code provided by Dicoding on GitHub, I created a Dockerfile and a shell script called `build_push_image.sh` to build and upload the image to Docker Hub. And also create a `docker-compose.yml` file that configures `item-app` and `item-db` services.
